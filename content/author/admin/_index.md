My main interests are in the fields of bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next-generation/third generation sequencing including the first multiple genome assembly projects. I am also developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study the genome structure, architecture, and evolution in grasses.
